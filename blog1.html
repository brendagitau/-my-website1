The belief that laughter heals the mind has been around for centuries. And why not?
Humor just feels good; it distracts us from our problems and promotes a lighter perspective. 
Research on humor has come into the sunlight of late, with humor now viewed as a character strength. 
Positive psychology, a field that examines what people do well, notes that humor can be used to make 
others feel good, to gain intimacy or to help buffer stress. Along with gratitude, hope and spirituality,
 a sense of humor belongs to the set of strengths positive psychologists call transcendence; together 
 they help us forge connections to the world and provide meaning to life.<br><br>

                Recently  I read  Trevor Noah’s Memoir , and it's  full of humor and not just the plain kind, 
                it has sarcasm ; this is seen in the notes Noah and his mother would send  each other to address a
                 problem between them. My  favourite part was when he explained that he was naughty in school because
                  his mother was also naughty in school so she shouldn't be upset with him since it's a genetic condition she passed on to him.<br><br>

            </p>

                Its funny  how Noah’s mind perceived situations ,especially when he was a child.A good example of this is when  in catholic school, he decided to  drink the entire 
                bottle of grape juice(which was his favorite juice) that was used as the blood of Jesus and  eat all the 
                crackers which stood for the body of christ,  that were to  be used for holy communion during Friday mass 
                at  school.His explanation for doing this was he did not agree with the rule that he could not ‘eat’ 
                holy communion with his classmates simply because he was not catholic.He always tried argue  with the  nuns and the 
                priest  to let him have holy communion but they didn’t. In  his he was a christian and that was enough,
                  even Jesus wasn't catholic and no one could stop Him from taking holy communion if he came to schhol so they couldn't stop him either. <br>
                 So he decided to do it himself.<br><br>

                Another funny part  in the book was how he described his parent’s relationship; <em><i>
                “My mom was like, ‘Whooo, I don’t care, I want a white man! Whoooo!’ And my dad was, 
                well, you know how the Swiss love chocolate.”</i></em> This had me giggling so hard.At this point I really wish I could make my thoughts more humorous and learn to laugh at myself more.
                  From reading this book I’ve learnt that my outlook on life should have more humor and that will protect me from all the trauma life  has to offer.
