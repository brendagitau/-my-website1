            <h1 >What do we really want? </h1><br> 
            <p>“Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, 
                as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for 
                that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient 
                women. He’s attracted to independent women. “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to
             put her in a cage. Trevor Noah in Born a Crime”<br> <br>

                So in the last blog I told you of my most recent reads, Trevor Noah’s memoir. Above is an excerpt that really  got me thinking.What do men want? 
                Actually not just men but women too as they too want the “bad boy”...you know  the one  who is not emotionally available, does not value us or our
                 opinions as we do theirs, is not honest or trustworthy, sends out mixed signals, etc.Yet, we cannot seem to stop thinking about them.
                 In the course of thinking and researching I found some matching themes that may be the cause of this glitch in reasoning.<br> <br>

            <p class="whycant"><h3>Why We Want What We Cannot Have:-</h3><br> <br> 

          <b>    1. We are excited about the thrill of the chase.<br> <br> 
               2. We believe if by being accepted by the individual we desire it will add value to us or validate us.<br> 
               3. It will satisfy our ego.<br> 
               4.  We struggle with low self-esteem.<br> 
               5. We are attracted to the unknown or unpredictability of the other person.<br> 
               6. We want to fulfill a fantasy.<br> 
               7. We want to prove to ourselves and others we deserve to have them.<br> 
               8. We unconsciously placed superhuman characteristics on our object of desire.<br> 
               9.The less the person reciprocates, the more time we tend to invest trying to get the person to reciprocate<br> <br> 
          </b>
                </p><br> 
                <p>So, when you want someone whom you simply cannot have, the best thing to do is relax, step back, and really think about why you want to be
                    with this person that is not interested in you.
                    When you do this you will  be able to think objectively without emotions clouding your judgment ,you will be true to yourself 
                    about your intentions and also I believe you will be able to see the other parties’ intentions from miles away whether they spell it out or not.
